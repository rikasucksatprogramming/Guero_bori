        <div style="text-align: center;" id="about">A “War Against all Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America’s colony”, was a great book to showcase the unheard stories of Puerto Ricans, <br/>
                                        the nationalist party, and our forgotten history. Robert Dominguez from the New York Times says after reading, “Prepared to be outraged”, <br/>
                                        as this book is filled with topics that will anger any Puerto Rican, from how the Americans spoke about us, to why we are so proud of our flag. <br/>
                                        This book is a very hard read as it is very descriptive but a very worthy read. This book will completely flip your world when it comes to the US and Puerto Rico. </div>
        <div style="text-align: center;" class="synopsis">Synopsis: “War against all Puerto Ricans” was divided into 3 sections with a few chapters in each, <br/>
                                         the first section being Facts, second being people, and third being Events. The first section corrects <br/>
                                         many misconceptions that a America centered media made, such as the fact that the Puerto Ricans were <br/>
                                         shooting police during the Ponce massacre while it was the complete opposite, it also talks about how <br/>
                                         the Americans failed with demonizing Spanish in the island, and much more. The second section dove into <br/>
                                         the important trailblazers and not so helpful people of the island. First diving into the weak governor <br/>
                                         who gave the Americans complete control of Puerto Rico for his own good, then into the trailblazers such <br/>
                                         as Pedro Albizu Campos, “The Nationalist” and el barbero. The last section talked about the fall of the <br/>
                                         Nationalist party as all their leaders were killed and were scared. The US was able to unleash propogranda <br/>
                                         to effectively control the island and essentially make people forget about the Nationalist movement or all <br/>
                                         of their leadership failures, leading us to today.. well 2015. </div>
